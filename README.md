# ProgWeb project
Greetings! 

This is a project developed for Professor Baz√≠lio's classes. It's an e-commerce for a simulated plant store called "Mudinhas e afins". We are keeping up this repository with all the plans and alterations on our work - it comes from the simulation of the screens to the main code. 

The project is still on progress, just as this readme page. 
 
 Developers: Carlos Linhares, Humberto Chave, Layla Sampaio e Thiago dos Santos
